Welcome to Brightcove App Cloud!

This template demonstrates some of the functionality of the App Cloud SDK. To 
use it, first install the free Workshop app on your mobile device.

GETTING STARTED

1. Download the Workshop app from the iTunes App Store or Android marketplace:

    iTunes: [link here]
    Android: https://market.android.com/details?id=com.brightcove.android.katama.previewapp

2. Copy the "demo" directory into your local web server. On OSX, this might be 
   "~/Sites/demo"

3. Load scan.html in your desktop web browser. You should access the file over
   your network, not via "localhost." The address might look like this:

   http://192.168.1.100/~adam/demo/scan.html

   Make sure your device can access the same network.

4. Open the Workshop app on your phone, click "Template Preview," then click 
   "Scan QR Code." Scan the code the appears on your desktop, then click "Go."

5. The template will appear on your device! You can now edit any file and see
   the changes take effect on the device. To refresh a view, simply drag and 
   release the "Menu" tab.
